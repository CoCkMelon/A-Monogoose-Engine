# Unity-like Platformer ECS - Improvements and Optimizations

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tilemap Collider Position Issue
**Problem:** Colliders were in wrong positions compared to the working kenney_pixel-platformer example.

**Not a solution:** 
- Added proper debugging logs in `PhysicsManager.h` to track tile size usage
- Ensured tile size is explicitly logged for collision creation
- The collision system now uses the exact same coordinate system as the working example

**Changes made:**
- In `PhysicsManager::LoadTilemapCollisions()`: Added explicit tile size variable and logging

**Issue remains after all that**

### 2. Player Sprite Texture Issue
**Problem:** Player sprite had no texture visible.

**Not the solutions:**
- Added comprehensive debugging in `PlayerBehaviour::SetPlayerTexture()`
- Added `spriteRenderer->enabled(true)` to ensure visibility
- Added texture verification logging to debug texture setting
- Improved initialization order documentation in GameManager

**Changes made:**
- Enhanced `PlayerBehaviour::SetPlayerTexture()` with better debugging and explicit enabled flag
- Added texture readback verification
- Added more detailed logging in `GameManager::Start()`

**Issue remains after all that**

## Project Structure Review

### Strengths
1. **Good Unity-like Architecture**: 
   - Clear separation of concerns with MongooseBehaviour scripts
   - Proper component-based design using ECS
   - Singleton pattern for PhysicsManager follows Unity conventions

2. **Clean Code Organization**:
   - Headers are well-structured and focused
   - Good use of C++ features while maintaining C interop
   - Proper RAII with unique_ptr for TMX data

3. **Proper Initialization Flow**:
   - Physics → Tilemap → Player → Camera → Linking
   - Appropriate use of Awake/Start lifecycle methods

4. **Engine specifics in MongooseBehaviour**:
   - Sprite is created using OpenGL and SDL calls in PlayerBehaviour

### Optimization Opportunities

#### Suggested Optimizations

1. **Collision Detection**:
   ```cpp
   // Current: Simple velocity-based ground check
   // Better: Implement proper raycast-based ground detection like working example
   ```

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Better Debugging
1. Add runtime component inspector (like Unity's Inspector)
2. Add visual debug rendering for physics bodies
3. Implement scene serialization/deserialization

### For Performance
1. Implement sprite batching system
2. Consider spatial partitioning for collision queries

### For Features
1. Add animation state machine
2. Implement proper ground detection with raycasting
3. Add sound system integration to unitylike example
4. Implement particle effects

## Building and Running

Despite all efforts, project still is:
- Improper tilemap collision alignment
- Visible player sprite without texture
- Partially comprehensive debugging output

Monitor the console output to verify:
- Texture loading: "GameManager: Loaded texture ID: [number]"
- Physics creation: "PhysicsManager: Physics world created: [pointer]"
- Player setup: "PlayerBehaviour: Sprite configured - size: (24.0, 24.0)"

## Technical Notes

### Component System
The project uses a hybrid approach:
- Heavy ECS for rendering (sprites, tilemaps) 
- MongooseBehaviour scripts for game logic
- C interop for core engine systems

### Memory Layout
- Script objects stored outside ECS (managed separately)
- Component data in ECS (POD structs)
- Texture/GPU resources managed by GameManager lifecycle

This architecture provides Unity-like ease of use while maintaining performance benefits of ECS for rendering.
